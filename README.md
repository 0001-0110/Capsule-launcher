# Capsule launcher

Welcome to the **Capsule launcher mod** for Factorio! This mod introduces a unique turret capable of launching capsules, providing new strategic options for your base defense. Whether it's deploying combat robots or delivering poison and slowdown effects at range, this turret opens up creative ways to secure your factory.

## Features:

A new turret, the capsule launcher, capable of firing all types of capsules, including:

  - Slowdown and poison capsules.
  - Combat robot capsules (defenders, distractors, and destroyers).

The turret can't be placed on space platforms.

## Coming Soon:

I'm actively developing this mod and have exciting features planned for future updates:

  - **New Graphics**:
    - Updated turret and capsule visuals to enhance the look and feel of the mod.
    - I don't have the skills to create new graphics myself, but if you do and are interested, please reach out!

  - **Standalone Mode**:
    - Support for using this mod without the Space Age mod (discussion ongoing).

## Out of Scope:

To keep the mod focused, I will not add support for grenades. While interesting, they fall outside the intended scope of capsule-based functionality.
